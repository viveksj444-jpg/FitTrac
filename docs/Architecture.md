# 🏗️ FitTrac Architecture

This document describes the overall architecture of the **FitTrac** application, including the frontend, backend, database, authentication flow, and request lifecycle.

---

# Architecture Overview

FitTrac follows the **MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)** architecture.

                     ▼
             MongoDB Atlas
```

The frontend communicates with the backend through REST APIs. The backend validates requests, performs business logic, and stores or retrieves data from MongoDB.

# Authentication Flow

```text
User Login
     │
     ▼
POST /api/auth/login
     │
     ▼
Verify Email & Password
     │
     ▼
Generate JWT Token
     │
     ▼
Return Token
     │
     ▼
Store Token (Frontend)
     │
     ▼
Authorization Header
     │
     ▼
Protected APIs
```

Every protected request sends:

```text
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN
```

The backend verifies the token before allowing access to protected resources.

|------|----|--------------|
| User | Meal | One-to-Many |
| User | Exercise | One-to-Many |
| Food | Meal | One-to-Many |

# Dashboard Architecture

The Dashboard acts as the application's analytics layer.

Instead of storing dashboard data, it calculates values dynamically using data from multiple collections.

```text
                User
                  │
        ┌─────────┴─────────┐
        │                   │
      Meals            Exercises
        │                   │
        ▼                   ▼
Calories Consumed     Calories Burned
        │                   │
        └─────────┬─────────┘
                  │
                  ▼
          Dashboard Controller
                  │
                  ▼
         Net Calories Calculation
                  │
                  ▼
           Dashboard Response
```

---

## Dashboard Responsibilities

The Dashboard Controller is responsible for:

- Fetching today's meals
- Fetching today's exercises
- Fetching today's water intake
- Calculating calories consumed
- Calculating calories burned
- Calculating net calories
- Calculating remaining calories
- Returning nutrition statistics

---

## Dashboard Formula

```text
Calories Consumed
        │
        ▼
Calories Burned
        │
        ▼
Net Calories

Net Calories = Consumed − Burned

Remaining Calories = Goal − Net Calories
```

The dashboard does not store calculated values in MongoDB. All values are generated dynamically when requested.

---

# Smart Recommendation Architecture

The Recommendation Engine is the intelligence layer of FitTrac.

Instead of storing recommendation data, the system analyzes the user's current nutrition each time the API is requested.

```text
             User
               │
               ▼
        Today's Meals
               │
               ▼
       Nutrition Summary
               │
               ▼
        Recommendation Engine
               │
     ┌─────────┼─────────┐
     │         │         │
     ▼         ▼         ▼
Protein   Calories   Hydration
Analysis  Analysis   Analysis
     │         │         │
     └─────────┼─────────┘
               ▼
     Smart Recommendations
               │
               ▼
          JSON Response
```

---

## Responsibilities

The Recommendation Controller:

- Reads today's meals
- Reads today's water intake
- Reads user fitness goal
- Calculates nutrition totals
- Compares intake against targets
- Generates personalized recommendations
- Returns recommendation cards

# Security

FitTrac uses several security practices:

- Password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT Authentication
- Protected API routes
- Environment variables for secrets
- MongoDB Atlas authentication

---

# Scalability

The project follows a modular architecture.

Each feature is separated into:

- Model
- Controller
- Route
- Service (Frontend)
- Hook (Frontend)
- UI Components

This makes the project easy to maintain and extend.
